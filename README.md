# ðŸ“š BookWise - Library Management System

## ðŸ“¦ How to Build & Run the Project

### 1. Install Java 21
- Download and install Java 21 from the official [Java Download Page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html).
- Make sure `java` is available in your system's `PATH`.

### 2. Install & Configure MySQL
- Install MySQL and start the server.
- Ensure it's running on `localhost` at port `3306`.
- Use the MySQL `root` user for access.

### 3. Set Database Password (if applicable)
If your MySQL `root` user has a password, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 4. Run the Project
Use the following command to build and run the project:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

All necessary SQL commands for setting up the BookWise database are included in a single script file named BookWise.sql.

This file combines the database schema creation (create_schema.sql) and the data initialization (initialize_data.sql) into one convenient script.

It will:

Create all required tables with appropriate constraints.

Populate each table with at least 15 entries, with no NULL values.

Error while deleting a book
The error you're seeing is not a bug or coding mistakeâ€”it's actually an intentional feature designed to maintain data integrity in the BookWise application. The system prevents you from deleting a book record if that book is currently on hold or loaned out, because removing it would break the relationships that other tables (like holds or loans) depend on. This safeguard ensures the database stays consistent and avoids orphaned records. To delete a book, all related holds and loans must be cleared first. This behavior is expected and necessary in any well-designed library management system.
