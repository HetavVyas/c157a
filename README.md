All necessary SQL commands for setting up the BookWise database are included in a single script file named BookWise.sql.

This file combines the database schema creation (create_schema.sql) and the data initialization (initialize_data.sql) into one convenient script.

It will:

Create all required tables with appropriate constraints.

Populate each table with at least 15 entries, with no NULL values.
